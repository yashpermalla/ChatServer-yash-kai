TODO: write a brief summary of how each team member contributed to
the project.

Together: Implemented significant fixes to sender.cpp, receiver.cpp and connection.cpp . This included
error handling, send/receive communications, etc.

Yash: Implemented initial connection.cpp and sender.cpp

Kai: Implemented initial receiver.cpp and some error handling in sender.cpp



Eventually your report about how you implemented thread synchronization
in the server should go here
